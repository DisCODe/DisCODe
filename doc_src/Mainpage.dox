DisCODe - [Dis]tributed [C]omponent [O]riented [D]ata Proc[e]ssing \par

This project contains sources of DisCODe - a framework facilitating the development of sensor data processing algorithms.
DisCODE is written mostly in C++ (in an objective manner) and composing of a components library with patterns for their usage.
Those patterns impose general implementation method diverse, multistage data processing algorithms.

It was important to develop mechanisms which will simplify the process of processing streams (algorithms) creation, enable switching between 
different tasks during the application work and, moreover, will offer clear method of their parts (components) separation. 
In order to create a general management mechanism dealing with any number of components, each of them is encapsulated in a separate
dynamic library - shared object (SO) in case of the Linux OS and DLL in case of Windows OS.

Components are divided into four classes:
 - sources - components responsible for gathering sensor data,
 - data processors - implementing one of the processing steps (algorithm parts),
 - sinks - final processing nodes, responsible for gathering processed data for e.g. their presentation on screen or saving to files.   
 - proxies - components responsible for communication with other processes/systems.

The approach required loose coupling between components, thus component-independent communication mechanisms had to be developed. 
Two types of mechanisms were created:
 - data streams - for passing sensorical data between components,
 - events - for passing commands between components, which can result in change of the method of their work, etc.
 
The component-oriented approach imposed also creation of utilities responsible for components load and management. 
Besides, diverse execution methods of processing streams were created, called executors, enabling users to execute the same components in different way.

Currently DisCODe focuses on computer vision application, thus contains components related mostly to the computer vision area, but there are also plans for creation of components useful for speech recognition. 

Besided there is some work done in order to utilize the results of DisCODe-based application in robotics - as a tool for aggregation of sensor data to the form useful in control.

This software was developed at:
 - Robot Control and Pattern Recognition Group,
 - Institute of Control and Computation Engineering,
 - Warsaw University of Technology, Poland
