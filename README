=== Introduction

DisCODe - Distributed Component Oriented Data Processing 

This project contains sources of DisCODe - a framework facilitating the developement of sensorical data processing algorithms.
DisCODE is written mostly in C++ (in an objective manner) and composing of a components library with patterns for their usage.
Those patterns impose general implementation method diverse, multistage data processing algorithms.

This software was developed at:
  Robot Control and Pattern Recognition Group,
  Institute of Control and Computation Engineering,
  Warsaw University of Technology, Poland
